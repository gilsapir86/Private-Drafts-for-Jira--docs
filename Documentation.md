# Secure Issue Drafts for Jira

### Overview

Secure Issue Drafts adds the "Save Draft" button that Jira is missing. It allows you to safely save your in-progress work on any issue without fear of losing it.

### How It Works

The app is designed to be simple and intuitive.

1. **Find the Panel:** After installing, open any Jira issue. You will see a new "Drafts" panel (or similar name) on the issue view.
2. **Save Your Draft:** Type your description or comments. Click the **"Save Draft"** button in the panel. Your work is now saved.
3. **Load Your Draft:** If you refresh the page or come back later, just click **"Load Draft"** to instantly restore your saved text.

### Your Security & Privacy

Your trust is our #1 priority. This app is built on Atlassian's native **Forge platform** for maximum security.

- **100% Private:** Your drafts are visible **only to you**. No one else, not even your Jira admin, can see them.
- **Data Stays in Atlassian:** Your draft data **never leaves your Atlassian instance**. It is stored securely using Forge's encrypted, built-in storage. We do not use any external servers.
